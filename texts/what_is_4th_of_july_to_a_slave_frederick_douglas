The papers and placards say, that I am to deliver a 4th of July oration. It is the birthday of your National Independence, and of your political freedom. 2/
"I shall not presume to dwell at length on the associations that cluster about this day. Oppression makes a wise man mad. Your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment."
"The freedom gained is yours; and you, therefore, may properly celebrate this anniversary. Cling to this day – cling to it, and to its principles, with the grasp of a storm-tossed mariner to a spar at midnight."
"Fellow Citizens, I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. They were peace men; but they preferred revolution to peaceful submission to bondage. With them, nothing was settled that was not right."
"With them, justice, liberty and humanity were final; not slavery and oppression. You may well cherish the memory of such men." 6/
"Friends and citizens, I need not enter further into the causes which led to this anniversary. Many of you understand them better than I do. You could instruct me in regard to them." 7/
"My business, if I have any here today, is with the present. We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future." 
"Fellow citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence?" 9/
"I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me."
"The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me." 11/
"This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, is inhuman mockery. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak today?"
"Above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, today, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them. My subject, then fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN SLAVERY."
"Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future."
Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the Bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon,  
 dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery – the great sin and shame of America!
I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just
But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind 18/
Would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuade more, and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed But, I submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? 19/
Must I argue that a system thus marked with blood, and stained with pollution, is wrong? No! I will not I have better employments for my time and strength 20/
At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed Oh! Had I the ability, and could I reach the nation’s ear, I would, today, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke 21/
For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake 22/
The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced 23/
What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim 24/
To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fronted impudence;   25/
your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy –    26/
a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour 27/
Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation,    28/
and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival 29/
Americans! Your republican politics are flagrantly inconsistent The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretense, and your Christianity as a lie 30/
It destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home It saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a byword to a mocking earth 31/
