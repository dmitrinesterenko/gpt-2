They tell me that they have been 'rehabilitated', that they have "not killed anybody" and they "would kill for America" and have no allegiance to a country.

As much as I hate her, Sarah Palin is a talented artist, but her own ideas are not that much better. She is a more conservative and practical politician, who would have been a staunch proponent of the Second Amendment, as he expressed in a statement: "This is about women's physical and emotional safety.

We can choose to be the people, the people we are supposed to be voting for, and the politicians that we are supposed to trust?

The law, which was designed to protect customers from identity theft, would require companies to make sure that personal information is safeguarded when it's shared with advertisers.

Some students are given the extra incentive of being the one to give the "gift" to them, but there's not the same level of respect to me; they feel more threatened by the notion that I may have an opinion.
