This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced."[16] The "propriety of the nation," in this case also, is to be roused, but not with the same intensity as that of Washington and his successors, who were to make "prophetic utterances,"[17] but with the urgency that is more than a little reminiscent of "His country, its rights, and the liberties thereof."

In addition to the speeches and essays that were published and disseminated, Jefferson also gave an address, entitled "The American Crisis in 1776," and in his second inaugural address, the speech is subtitled "A Memorial and Remonstrance" against the American Revolution and for the preservation of the independence of the country and of the institution of representative government.[18] In this address and in his other public utterances, Jefferson expressed his opposition to the idea of a revolution and his wish that the country might have been preserved as it was. In particular, Jefferson spoke of the necessity of a republic, although, like Washington, he believed that a monarchical form of government existed in the colonies and could only be removed by a revolution, and he also considered that the nation was in danger, being torn by civil war, and therefore it was necessary to "restore peace and order,"[19] to establish "a republican form of government,"[20] to "restore our national honor and national interests to the honor we owe them,"[21] as well as to "save the blessings [to] our country from misgovernment and oppression."[22]

The speech was composed during Washington's presidency and was delivered in February 1784 in Philadelphia, the city located at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers. However, the context is important, because the address was written soon after the publication of Washington's Second Annual Message to Congress, wherein he declared that it was necessary to form separate branches of government as a safeguard against corruption and tyranny. Jefferson, however, held different views on the need for separate powers to be separated as a part of the republic concept, because he recognized the benefits of the strong influence of the majority and feared that the same interests would be present in the legislature and might lead to the accumulation of so many rights that the government might end up losing most of its constitutional authority. Jefferson, therefore, suggested that the people must first be given the right to elect their representatives and then must be given the power to abolish that power, in order to form a representative government that would be more responsive and less prone to excessive influence
